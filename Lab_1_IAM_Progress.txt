# AWS Security Journey

## Day 1 - Feb 5, 2026

### What I Did Today:
- ✅ Created AWS account with MFA enabled
- ✅ Set up billing alerts (threshold: $5)
- ✅ Launched first EC2 instance (t2.micro, Amazon Linux 2023)
- ✅ Configured Security Group (SSH from my IP only)
- ✅ Connected via SSH successfully
- ✅ Hardened SSH configuration (disabled root login)
- ✅ Created security audit script

### AWS Services Used:
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Security Groups
- CloudWatch (for billing alerts)

### Key Learnings:
1. Security Groups are stateful firewalls (like iptables but cloud-native)
2. AWS Free Tier gives 750 hours/month of t2.micro (enough for 24/7 usage)
3. Default Amazon Linux comes with many security best practices enabled
4. Public key authentication is required (no password SSH)

### Differences from RHEL:
- Amazon Linux uses `yum` (similar to RHEL)
- Default user is `ec2-user` (not root)
- Cloud-init handles initial setup
- Instance metadata service provides cloud-specific info

### Tomorrow's Plan:
- Start Stephane's course (IAM section)
- Deep dive into IAM users, groups, policies
- Hands-on: Create IAM users and test permissions

### Time Spent: 4 hours
### Status: ✅ Day 1 Complete!

Create Day 1 lab folder:

bashmkdir -p labs/day1

Document your EC2 hardening:

bashcat > labs/day1/ec2-hardening.md << 'EOF'
# Day 1 Lab: EC2 Instance Hardening

## Objective
Launch and secure an EC2 instance following security best practices.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Instance Launch
- AMI: Amazon Linux 2023
- Instance Type: t2.micro (Free Tier)
- Security Group: SSH from my IP only
- Key Pair: RSA key for authentication

### 2. Security Hardening Applied
```bash
# Disabled root SSH login
sudo sed -i 's/#PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart sshd

# Updated all packages
sudo yum update -y

# Installed security tools
sudo yum install -y nmap nc telnet
```

### 3. Security Audit Script Created
Created `security-check.sh` to audit:
- SSH configuration
- Active users
- Open ports
- Recent login history

## Security Posture
✅ Root login disabled
✅ SSH key-based authentication only
✅ Firewall configured (Security Group)
✅ System fully updated
✅ Audit logging in place

## Next Steps
- Implement automated security scanning
- Configure CloudWatch monitoring
- Enable CloudTrail for audit logging

Copy your audit report from EC2:

bash# In your local terminal (not EC2):
scp -i ~/Downloads/aws-security-key.pem ec2-user@YOUR_INSTANCE_IP:~/day1-audit-report.txt labs/day1/

Create .gitignore:

bashcat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
*.pem
*.ppk
*.key
.DS_Store
EOF

Commit to Git (local for now):

bashgit add .
git commit -m "Day 1: First EC2 instance launched and hardened"

Minute 150-180: GitHub + LinkedIn
GitHub Setup:

Go to github.com
Sign up or log in
Create new repository:

Name: aws-security-journey
Description: "My transition from Linux Security to AWS Cloud Security - Daily progress tracking"
Public (so employers can see)
Don't initialize with README (you already have one)


Push your code:

bash# In your aws-security-journey folder:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aws-security-journey.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

🚀 Day 1: Starting My AWS Cloud Security Journey

After 6 years of securing Linux systems and conducting security assessments, I'm transitioning to Cloud Security.

Today's achievements:
✅ Launched and hardened my first AWS EC2 instance
✅ Configured security groups and IAM
✅ Started AWS Certified Security Specialty prep
✅ Created security audit automation script

Target: AWS Certified Security - Specialty by April 2026

CRITICAL: Stop Your EC2 Instance (Save Money)
Before you finish today:
bash# Exit from EC2
exit

# In AWS Console:
# EC2 → Instances → Select your instance → Instance State → Stop
# (Don't terminate - you'll use this tomorrow)
```

**Why?**
- Running instance = charges after 750 hours
- Stopped instance = NO charges (only storage ~₹10/month)
- You can start it again tomorrow in 30 seconds

**Daily habit:** Start when you need it, stop when done.
